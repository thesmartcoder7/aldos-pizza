## Behaviour Driven Development 
The user is able to;
- Choose the size of pizza they want e.g Small, Medium, Large

- Choose what kind of crust they would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free

- Choose the topping(s) they want on my pizza.

- Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.

- Have an option to order as many pizzas as they want.

- Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered the user is alerted of how much the delivery charge will be.

- Enter where the delivery should be made and then gets an alert saying  "your order will be delivered to your location"

- See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
